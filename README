Welcome Abord the Sauce Boat
============================

`sauceboat` is an ETL library that doesn't get in a programmer's way and is
built around conventions rather than an API. Simply put, `sauceboat` pipes
containers into functions that themselves return containers. Combined with
iterators, it makes for a light and memory-friendly ETL solution.

Right now, the closest thing to documentation can be found in `examples/`.

The name[1]_ comes from a variation around `saucebrush` [2]_ which is a similar
project.
