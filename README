# Welcome Abord the Sauce Boat

ETL library that doesn't get in the programmer's way and is
built around conventions rather than an API. Simply put, `sauceboat` pipes
containers into functions that themselves return containers. Combined with
iterators, it makes for a light and memory-friendly ETL solution.

Right now, the closest thing to documentation can be found in `examples/`.

The name comes from a variation around `saucebrush` which is a
[similar project](https://bitbucket.org/sunlightlabs/saucebrush).
